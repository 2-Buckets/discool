A place for me to keep my custom discord themes at. (My themes suck :pensiveblob:)

Welcome. I see you have found the README.md file. If your wondering, yes, I stole some of these themes. This is just for me to use so I can change some themes on discord without having to write them all out. (Using github is easier because it keeps my code looking nice for when friends use it.)

Anyways, you can get out of here now, as I don't have anything important for you.
